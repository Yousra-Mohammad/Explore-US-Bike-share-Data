# Explore-US-Bike-share-Data

Explore US Bike Share Data project - Udacity Data Analysis Professional Track.

In this project, I used Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy to understand Bikeshare-Data using dataf or a bike-share system called "Divvy" for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington and write a code to import it and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also, I Applied statistics to analyze the behavior of its subscribers, as an example to know what is the most common day, the hour that the subscribers are using the system, and the common generation
And an interactive environment finally has been built that enables the user to choose the data and filter for a dataset to analyze.

## Software used in this project:
  - Python3
  - NumPy
  - Pandas

## The Datasets:
You will need the three city dataset files too:

 - chicago.csv
 - new_york_city.csv
 - washington.csv
 
All these files are attached with the project.

**All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:**

  - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
  - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
  - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
  - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
  - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
  - User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
  
**The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:**

  - Gender
  - Birth Year
